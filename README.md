Homework #2
In this exercise, I made use of the csv python library functionality to access and also read through a csv file containing periodcic profit results for a hypothetical company. A variery of python built-in functions and methods such as 'for loops', sum function, '+=' operator, f-strings and others were employed in order to calculate a set of financial statistics using the data on the csv file.The financial statistic summary results were then exported to a text file for ease of reading. The text file can be found on the repository as well as 'financial analysis results.txt'.
