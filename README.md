# python-homework #1


In this exercise, I made use of functionality within the 'csv' python library to access and also read through a csv. formatted file containing periodic profit results for a hypothetical company. A varierty of python built-in functions and methods such as 'for loops', sum function, '+=' operator, f-strings and others were employed in order to calculate and depic a set of financial statistics based on the data contained in the source csv file. The financial statistics summary results were then exported to a text file for ease of reading. The text file can be found on the repository as well under 'financial analysis results.txt'.
