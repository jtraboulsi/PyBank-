Homework #2

In this exercise, I made use of the csv python library functionality to access and also read through a csv file containing periodic profit results for a hypothetical company. A variery of python built-in functions and methods such as 'for loops', sum function, '+=' operator, f-strings and others were employed in order to calculate and present a set of financial statistics based on the data from the source csv file. The financial statistica summary results were then exported to a text file for ease of reading. The text file can be found on the repository as well as 'financial analysis results.txt'.
