# PyBank homework assignment

I made use of functionality within the 'csv' Python library to read through a csv. format file that contains periodic profit results for a hypothetical company. Relevant native python functions and methods such as 'for loops', sum function, '+=' operator, f-strings and others were leveraged to calculate and depict a set of financial analysis results. The  summary results were then exported to a text file for ease of reading. The text file can be found on the repository as well under 'financial analysis results.txt'.
